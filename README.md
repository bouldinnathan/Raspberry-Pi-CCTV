Answer the few questions with “y” or “n”.
If you do not know “y” is probably the answer.

Once the questions have been answered and the update has finished click ok on the popup.
After a couple of hours, it will ask one final question (Is this correct (y/n)).
If you want the autostart function on type “y”.
